This Repository Houses the Assembler for a computer I built in the Desmos graphing calculator
You can access the computer [here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/dc45aa2ae7).

The whole assembler was a little rushed as the window for the Desmos 2025 Art Contest closed, but it does its job well enough and I am satisfied with it.

This entire project is open-source, and I would greatly appreciate people making their own modifications to both the computer and the assembler as they wish. Have fun!
